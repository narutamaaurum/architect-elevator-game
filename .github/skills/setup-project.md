# Skill: Setup Project

## Purpose

Bring a fresh clone of this repo to a runnable state, verify the toolchain, and confirm the dev server is serving the game. Use this skill when:

- You've just cloned the repo.
- `node_modules/` is missing or stale (e.g. after switching Node versions).
- You want to confirm typecheck / lint / unit tests still pass before starting work.

The project is already scaffolded (TypeScript strict, Phaser 3.90, Vite, Vitest, Playwright) — there is no "bootstrap from empty directory" step.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** — minimum **20.19** (Vite 8 requires `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`; Vitest 4 requires `^20.0.0 || ^22.0.0 || >=24.0.0`). Recommended LTS: **20.19+**, **22.12+**, or **24+**. Node 18 and Node 22 below 22.12 are **not** supported.
- **npm** — the lockfile is `package-lock.json`. Do not substitute pnpm / yarn.

## Steps

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This installs Phaser, Vite, Vitest, Playwright, ESLint, TypeScript, and everything declared in `devDependencies`.

2. (First-time only) Install Playwright browsers if you plan to run E2E tests:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

3. Run the dev server to confirm the toolchain works end-to-end:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Vite serves on `http://localhost:3000` (port configured in `vite.config.ts`). The game should boot into `MenuScene`.

4. Run the fast local checks before starting or finishing work:
   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   npm run lint
   npm run test:unit
   ```
   These three together are the "pre-PR gate" for pure-docs changes; for code changes, consider `npm run test:all` (slow — ask the user first).

## Scripts reference

From `package.json`:

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Vite dev server (`window.__game` / `__testHooks` always on unless `VITE_EXPOSE_TEST_HOOKS=false`). |
| `npm run build` | `tsc && vite build` — typecheck is part of the build. |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally. |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint across the repo. |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit`. |
| `npm run test:unit` | Vitest (pure logic; jsdom). |
| `npm run test:unit:watch` | Vitest in watch mode. |
| `npm run test:unit:coverage` | Vitest with coverage; 80% (75% branches) on `src/systems/**`; 80% on `src/input/**`; 75% (70% branches) on `src/ui/**`; 60% on `src/entities/**`; 40% lines / 20% branches / 35% functions / 40% statements on `src/scenes/**`; 45% / 40% / 40% / 45% on `src/features/floors/**`; 75% / 60% / 70% / 75% on `src/features/floors/boss/**`. |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright integration specs (excludes `@visual`). |
| `npm run test:headed` / `test:ui` | Playwright with visible browser / interactive UI. |
| `npm run test:report` | Open the last Playwright HTML report. |
| `npm run test:visual:update` | Run the `@visual` suite and refresh snapshot PNGs — the only script that exercises visual specs. To verify against existing baselines without updating, invoke `npx playwright test tests/visual.spec.ts --grep @visual` directly. |
| `npm test` | `test:unit && test:e2e`. |
| `npm run test:all` | `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run test:unit -- --coverage && npm run test:e2e` — opt-in, slow. |

## Conventions to keep in mind

- **TypeScript strict, ES modules.** Do not add `.js` source files.
- **No `public/assets/` directory.** Sprites and SFX are generated procedurally at runtime by `SpriteGenerator` and `SoundGenerator`. Static files: `public/music/` (MP3/OGG/WAV tracks) and `public/brand/` (the Norconsult Digital wordmark SVG, loaded as `lobby_logo` at boot).
- **Filenames.** Scenes, entities, UI components, and systems use PascalCase filenames matching the exported class. Config / tooling files are lowercase.
- **Test-hook globals.** `src/main.ts` exposes `window.__game` (Phaser.Game) and `window.__testHooks` (`{ QuizDialog, canRetryQuiz, eventBus }`) whenever `VITE_EXPOSE_TEST_HOOKS !== 'false'` — default-on in dev, preview, and production. Playwright relies on both. Build with `VITE_EXPOSE_TEST_HOOKS=false` for a hardened bundle (see README "Build flags").

## Adding new scenes / floors / content

See the companion skills:

- `.github/skills/new-scene.md` — adding a Phaser scene (infrastructure, floor, or product room).
- `CLAUDE.md` → "How to extend" — the canonical how-to index for floors, enemies, sound effects, music, info cards, quizzes, and zones.

## Notes

- `.gitignore` already covers `node_modules/`, `dist/`, Vite cache, Playwright reports, and coverage output.
- If `npm install` fails with peer-dep errors, check your Node version against the lockfile's build environment rather than forcing `--legacy-peer-deps`.
